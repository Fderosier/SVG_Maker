# SVG-logo-maker
The goal of this project was to develop a command line function that utilizes inquirer to present prompts to the user for generating a customized logo. The user is limited to 3 characters to be displayed within a triangle, square, or circle. Both the text and shape will have distinct colors chosen by the user. Subsequently, a file containing the user's image will be generated, alongside a test HTML file for previewing the logo.



Usage

Upon entering 'node index.js' in the command line, the user will encounter a sequence of prompts. Initially, the user will input the desired characters and select the text color. Following this, the user will choose a shape from the options of square, circle, or triangle. Subsequently, the user will designate the color for the selected shape. Upon completing the final prompt, a console log message will display "Generated logo.svg". A new file named logo.svg will then be generated within the project, accessible through the shapes.html file for the user to view the finalized logo.

Installation
Simply type NPM i into the command line to install all associated dependencies.

Conclusion

To conclude, I discovered that the most challenging aspect of this assignment, for me, was getting started. While adhering to the file structure provided by instructors, I initially felt overwhelmed by the idea of generating an image. Utilizing inquirer to present prompts served as my starting point, and gradually, I tackled each subsequent task methodically. After conducting research, I determined that implementing the user's chosen shape using switch and cases was the most effective approach. Delving further into SVG image creation involved understanding the straightforward coding involved, alongside the nuanced adjustments required to meet project requirements. The meticulous tweaking of the image proved to be the most time-consuming part of the project for me. Initially incorporating add-ons for character limitation and color selection, I later transitioned to utilizing various validation techniques, following discussions with my instructors, to streamline processes and enhance my skills. While initially daunting, breaking down the project into manageable components revealed its complexity to be more manageable than anticipated.
